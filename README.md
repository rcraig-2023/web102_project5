# Web Development Project 5 - *Brewery Dashboard*

Submitted by: **Rica Craig**

This web app: **This Brewery Dashboard fetches, displays, and summarizes brewery data from the Open Brewery DB API, allowing users to search and filter the results.**

Time spent: **3** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] **The site has a dashboard displaying a list of data fetched using an API call**
  - The dashboard should display at least 10 unique items, one per row
  - The dashboard includes at least two features in each row
- [x] **`useEffect` React hook and `async`/`await` are used**
- [x] **The app dashboard includes at least three summary statistics about the data** 
  - The app dashboard includes at least three summary statistics about the data, such as:
    - *insert details here*
- [x] **A search bar allows the user to search for an item in the fetched data**
  - The search bar **correctly** filters items in the list, only displaying items matching the search query
  - The list of results dynamically updates as the user types into the search bar
- [x] **An additional filter allows the user to restrict displayed items by specified categories**
  - The filter restricts items in the list using a **different attribute** than the search bar 
  - The filter **correctly** filters items in the list, only displaying items matching the filter attribute in the dashboard
  - The dashboard list dynamically updates as the user adjusts the filter

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

- Integrating the initial authenticated API from Cooper Hewitt, encountering data fetching errors likely related to complex URL parameters or authentication.
- Adapting the application logic after needing to switch from the Cooper Hewitt API to a simpler, unauthenticated Open Brewery DB API.
- Restructuring the UI rendering logic from the initial card-based layout to a table format with defined columns and adding appropriate CSS.
